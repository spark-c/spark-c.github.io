                <p>
                    Hiya! I am having a great time working with Python and JavaScript and whatever other techs I come across end up needing to learn in order to do my thing.
                </p>
                
                <p>A decade of ballet taught me:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Persistence and discipline are the foundation of improvement.</li>
                    <li>Beauty comes from doing something so many times that it becomes an art.</li>
                    <li>When you study an art, you recognize beauty hidden in everything.</li>
                    <li>Every thing and every skill can be an art.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>When someone performs their art, I want to understand it. I seek these new ideas at every turn, so that I can appreciate their beauty -- That beauty inspires learning.</p>

                <p>Later, I will remember my new skill -- that person's art -- and use it to make my own work better.</p>

                <p>More informed. More effective. More efficient. More beautiful.</p>

                <p>Your art is fascinating... tell me about it!</p>
