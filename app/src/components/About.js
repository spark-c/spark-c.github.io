                    My name is Collin Sparks! I am having a great time working with Python and JavaScript and whatever other techs I come across end up needing to learn in order to do my thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is another paragraph that I am writing such that we can see how this all looks once it's on the page! I am interested to see how it turns out.
